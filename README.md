A simple tool, which allows the user to upload a .sprite3 file and recieve a spritesheet of the sprite!

# Important info:

# How do you use it?
First you'll need to have a .sprite3 which you can get by goin into the Scratch 3 editor, right-clicking your sprite and pressimg export. Depending on the device you might have to confirm a download.
Next up: Open the tool and click on the area with the scratch cats head to open the .sprite3. This won't upload the file to any servers, all operation are done in your browser on your local machine.
Once succesfully uploaded, you can use the slider to define how many images you want per row on the spritesheet. This value can range from 1 to the amount of costumes in your sprite.
You can now click on the generate button to generate the spritesheet. A preview will be shown bellow the button, so you can tweak the settings again. Note: Everytime you change the settings, you will have to regenerate the spritesheet.
